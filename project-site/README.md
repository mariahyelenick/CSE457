Running Notes and Ideas

Discussing designs
- We are scrapping the idea of using a map as our primary design - our locations are more limited than previously thought and we believe there are better ways to represent the average users on OkCupid

- Showing mostly breadth and a little bit of depth of data, we are thinking of using a sunburst diagram, where ideally a user could pick an order of categories to filter data. This would be really could if someone wanted to see the number of profiles that fit into each hierarchy. One could look for, say, women in the bay area who have a pet.

- Maybe users could include/exclude specific categories as well? Still considering that option

Categories for the Sunburst
- Age (by groupings)
- Gender
- Location (categorical)
- Orientation
- Sign (categorical)
- Religion (categorical)

More Brainstorming
- The biggest concerns we have with the sunburst is that groups may get really small and difficult to view the further out from the center you go, so we might also want to have a visualization that allows for more depth for the user to explore data. Maybe some kind of clustering graph?

- We'd also like to represent the personal essays somehow, so a third part could be a senten tree of the text data, that could be filtered through interaction with the sunburst (and maybe the more in-depth graph if it's feasible to implement that)
